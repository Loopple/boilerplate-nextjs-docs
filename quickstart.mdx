### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Before running the project, make sure to add the necessary environment variables to your `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project. Read about all of them in the [env variables page](/env-variables).


### 2. Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Development

Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

The development server will be running at http://localhost:3000.


### 4. Build for production

```
npm run build
```

### 5. Linting

To run linting checks, use:

```
npm run lint
```

Linting helps ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.


### 6. Set Up Supabase Database

Before running the project, you need to create the "projects" table in your Supabase database. Follow these steps to create the table using the SQL editor:

1. **Visit the Supabase Dashboard**: Go to the Supabase Dashboard and sign in or create an account if you haven't already.

2. **Create a New Project**: Click on the "New Project" button to create a new project. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

3. **Access the SQL Editor**: Once your project is created, navigate to the SQL editor from the left sidebar menu.

4. **Create the Projects Table**: Use the SQL editor to create a table named "projects" with columns for the project data:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE projects (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
       title TEXT,
       description TEXT
   );
